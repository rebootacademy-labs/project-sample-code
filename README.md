## To start your local server

The first time you start the server you may install the dependencies. To do so, just go to the terminal and type:

```
$ npm install
```

After that you can start your server anytime with:

```
$ npm start
```

You should see something like:
```
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://192.168.43.142:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

Happy coding!
